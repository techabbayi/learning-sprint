# Understanding the Data Science Lifecycle: Question → Data → Insight

## 1. Explaining the Lifecycle

The **Question → Data → Insight** lifecycle is the fundamental framework that makes data science work meaningful. It's not just three steps—it's a way of thinking that ensures we're solving real problems, not just playing with numbers.

### Why Start with a Clear Question?

A well-defined question guides everything that follows:
- **Determines what data we need** - Without knowing what we're trying to understand, we can't collect relevant information
- **Shapes how we analyze** - Different questions require different approaches
- **Defines success** - We know when we've found something useful

**Example:** "What does our data tell us?" is too vague. But "Which customer behaviors in week 1 predict retention after 3 months?" is specific, measurable, and actionable.

### Understanding Data as Evidence, Not Truth

Data always has limitations:
- Missing values, measurement errors, or biases
- Captures what was measured, not necessarily what matters most
- Reflects the context in which it was collected

Before analyzing, we must understand:
- **Where it came from** - Logs? Surveys? Sensors?
- **What each variable represents** - Units, definitions, measurement methods
- **What's missing or unreliable** - Gaps, outliers, data quality issues

This healthy skepticism prevents misinterpretation and ensures we're using data appropriately.
